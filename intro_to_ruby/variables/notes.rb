Notes on variables

Variables are containers of information

assignment operator (=) assigns a value
equality operator (==) checks if two things are equal

Getting Data from a User
(gets) get string
(user data will print followed by a \n which represents the enter key being pressed.)\
To eliminate \n (newline character) we use .chomp
