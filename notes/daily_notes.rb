Finally begin the intro to ruby textbook.  I spent the better part of yesterday
working on my preparations and doing a few examples.

I'm still trying to update my version of ruby.  I would much rather struggle with it now rather than later.

- Spent my morning hour attempting to reinstall ruby and gems to the highest version.
I believe my issue was rvm... It appears that I was able to uninstall ruby and reinstall with rvm
I am now using v 2.7.2 and was able to successifully install the pry gem .

PRY -
where 'binding.pry' was declared- the program will open up a new pry session that allows you to debug and
inspect the code.
A better option that simply using puts as this allows you to see what's really happening with your code.
