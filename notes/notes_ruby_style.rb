snake_case for : methods, variables, and files. ( All lower case letters and using
underscores to separate words)

CONSTANTS should be in all uppercase letters

Curly braces {} for when working with do...end blocks on single line.

Use PascalCase / CamelCase when declaring a class name.  Capitalize the first
letter of each word. (no spaces)

Three data types: Numeric, Boolean, & Strings

Methods are special traits you can call on strings such as .length / .upcase / .downcase

* 'gets' allows for user input when working with Ruby.
If you add the method '.chomp' it will remove the extra line that would normally print after
running 'gets'. It is not necessary but will help you avoid having extra lines everywhere.

String interpolation = #{(variable)}
