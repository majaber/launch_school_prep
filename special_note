I've formally switched from the Javascript track in Launch School to
Ruby.
The prospect of learning 2 languages, and more importantly learning JIT (just in time)
learning, was too appealing to pass up.

I'd love to get a job in software sooner rather than later, but rushing will not
do me any good.  I want to remain focused and continue to push forward.

I made it all the way through the prep material about 18 months ago before my son
was born.  When it came time to commit to the core curriculum and enter my credit
card information I paused.  I asked myself 'are you really ready to commit to this'.
The price made sense but would I only be wasting my time and the instructors' time.

I noticed I had skipped over the "Learning how to learn" and computer science videos
the first time around.  As I reflected I noticed I still had a long way to go before
I was truly prepared to tackle the core curriculum.

Now, many months later I was able to tackle the prep material with a renewed vigor.
I had gone through all of the texts before but this time things stuck a lot better.
I feel focused, energized, and motivated!
